Troy course CS6647
Simulation and Modeling course.
I learned concepts such as randomness.
Data generating processes, resampling methods, and bootstrapping techniques were used.
Key algorithms such as Monte Carlo simulations and the Markov Decision Process, which are used to develop numerical simulation models were used to solve real-world problems.
I developed simulation models to help to get accurate results and enhance decision-making processes.
Optimization techniques were used to modify the performance of a model to improve results and make optimal use of resources.
